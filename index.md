# Meeting Place and Times

Troop 667 meets in the education building at Chesterbrook United Methodist Church, 1711 Kirby Road,
McLean, every Tuesday from 7:30-8:30 p.m.

# Sponsorship, Brief History, and Activities

Troop 667 is sponsored by the Chesterbrook United Methodist Church located at 1711 Kirby Rd., McLean. The
troop was first chartered in September, 1954. Since 2001, 25 members of Troop 667 have advanced to the rank
of Eagle Scout. The troop’s activities include rank advancement work at meetings and on camping trips; a mix of
backpacking and drive-in camping trips, and community service projects.

# Fees

Troop 667 charges an annual registration-dues fee of $125.00. This covers the National Boy Scout Council
registration fee of $72.00, Boy’s Life subscription fee of $12.00, and troop dues of $41.00. The troop collects the
registration-dues fees from current members during October or a prorated amount from new members based on
the month they join the troop.

# Uniform

Troop 667 members wear the khaki uniform shirt and pants at regular troop meetings and the troop t-shirt and
jeans on camping trips. The Scout uniform shorts and a Scouting T-shirt can be worn to meetings and camp
during the summer.

Due to Covid-19 wearing a mask inside is required 

# Advancement Program

Troop 667 has an active advancement program covering the full range of ranks from Scout to Eagle. The troop
conducts three courts of honor during the year to recognize those members who have advanced in rank,
completed merit badges, or earned special awards.

# Patrol Method

Troop 667 follows the patrol method at troop meetings and on camping trips. For this reason activities during
troop meetings and while on camping trips will center around the patrols with the members of each patrol
expected to follow the directions of their patrol leader. For camping trips, Troop 667 Scouts will determine tent
assignments, develop menus, and generate duty rosters using the members in their patrol. Generally a new Scout
is assigned to a patrol that has some of his friends from school. If several Webelos Scouts from the same pack
and den join Troop 667, a new patrol is formed for these Scouts and one of the Troop’s older, more experienced
Scouts serves as their patrol leader for the first year.
